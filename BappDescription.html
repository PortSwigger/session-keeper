Session Keeper is a simple and quick way to keep your session alive in Burp Suite with minimal impact on your requests. This tool is perfect for those instances when you need to keep a session active while away from your desk or even when taking a break or a nap. You can ensure the session stays alive for as long as necessary, but remember that an everlasting session must be supported on the server-side.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
Start by identifying a low-impact request that has a session you want to keep alive, such as a server time request, a simple API request, or a ping/pong request. Right-click the request and navigate to Extensions &rarr; Session Keeper &rarr; Send to Session Keeper.
</p>

<p>
Next, go to the Session Keeper tab and determine the frequency for sending the low-impact request. You can set a maximum number of requests if you do not want to send them indefinitely and then click start.
</p>

<p>
Session Keeper will start sending the request at the interval you set. Its important to note that the processing time of the request is not included in the countdown timer.
</p>

<p>
The top window displays the current request being sent, the middle window shows the response, and the bottom window presents a history of the requests. If you need to reset the request history window, use the Clear Log button at the top.
</p>

<p>
With Session Keeper, you can keep multiple sessions active simultaneously, thanks to its tab-based system.
